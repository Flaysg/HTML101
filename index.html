     <!-- This is an ANCHOR tag, used to link a location within the file, or link the tag to a completely different webpage
    Remember, without an anchor attribute, the link will be useless. These are entered into the opening tag - below is an EXTERNAL link example-->
    <h2>My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">youtube</a> page</h2>
    <h3>Hello</h3>
    <h4>Hello</h4>
    <!-- The following ANCHOR link is INTERNAL to an index file-->
    <a href="about.html">About</a>
     <!-- This anchor is to a file embedded in a folder-->
    <a href="details/newabout.html">Details Link</a>
    <!-- Paragraphs do not have a hierarchy, they're simple. Theyre also used to split lines of text -->
    <p>I am a paragraph</p>
     <!-- This is simple bold-->
    <p><b>This is very bold</b></p>
     <!-- This is strong, also used to bold text but has the added benefit of semantic meaning to the browser, 
      the browser will read this text as more important than the rest-->
    <p><strong>This is very STRONG</p>
     <!-- The stress tag here will be used to italicise or 'stress' the text
    This is an IN-LINE element. It does not start on a new line, and only takes up as much width as necessary, 
    as opposed to a BLOCK element -->
    <p><b>Hi!</b> how <em> are </em> you???</p>
